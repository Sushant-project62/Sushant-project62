**📊 CarDekho Website Analysis Report**

Web analytics project using SimilarWeb, Excel, and visualization tools to analyze 105M+ visits, SEO dominance, and digital marketing performance of CarDekho.com.
Uniqueness: Actionable insights on SEO, traffic, competitor benchmarking.
Performance: Insights backed by real SimilarWeb data (100M+ visits) — ensuring high reliability instead of accuracy **94%** (since it’s analytics).
**link:**

**🌐 Multilingual Car Review Sentiment Analysis**

Cross-language sentiment analysis using Deep-Translator + VADER + Logistic Regression. Deployed with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
Uniqueness: Multilingual pipeline with **translation + ML (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) + Streamlit app.**
Performance: Achieved **86%** classification accuracy **(strong for positive/negative, weaker on neutral due to class imbalance).**


**🌱 Smart Farming – IoT Crop Recommendation**

IoT + ML based solution to recommend suitable crops using sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture). Integrated with Blynk Cloud for real-time mobile dashboard.
An IoT + ML-based crop recommendation system using **sensor data + Random Forest.**
Uniqueness: Real-time IoT integration with cloud dashboard **(Blynk)** for farmers.
Performance: Achieved **95%** model accuracy on the crop dataset **(validated on test set, not overfit).**
